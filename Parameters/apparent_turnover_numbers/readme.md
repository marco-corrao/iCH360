Apparent turnover numbers (turnover numbers scaled by a saturation factor) used to parametrise EC-*i*CH360. 

These values were obtained by simultaneously fitting measurements of enzyme abundances (estimated from proteomic data in [1]) across multiple growth conditions. As a result, this is a condition-unspecific parameter set which was can used to predict average enzyme abundances (in the geomtric mean sense) across growth conditions.
